# Design

## Goal

## Things to teach

- How to use `<str>.join()`
- How to use `<str>.split()`
- Know how to manipulate strings to create new strings.

## Things not to teach

- Regex: `regex`.  That is for a different exercise.
- Iteration: Although strings are iterable, this is not the focus of this exercise.


## Prerequisites

- `basics`: The student should be familiar with the basics exercise.
