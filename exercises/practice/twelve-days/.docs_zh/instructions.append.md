This challenge _could_ be solved with a minimum of code and a lot of hardcoded text which is duplicated between the verses.
However, this song is a type of [cumulative song][cumulative song], where each new verse builds on the verse that comes before it.
For more of a programming challenge, consider assembling each verse from its parts.
For example, for each verse, the day changes and the gift changes, and the rest of the verse is pretty much the same.
What might be a good strategy for avoiding repetition?
